# Magpie Client
Magpie Client is an experimental 1.21 Minecraft client created with my vision and ideas. To be clear, I have no intention of stealing the work of mod creators. I made a GitHub repository with their mods because it was my only option. I have credited every creator and mod, but I do not have their permission.

## Features
1. Quality of life mods that do not exceed the cheat limit
2. Shaders, Emissive Textures, and Connected Textures are supported with Sodium, Indium, Iris, and Continuity
3. All HUD mods are configured and work well together

## Credits
- To all the creators of the mods used in this modpack
- And chrono_t for modifying his mod
