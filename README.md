# Magpie Client
Magpie Client is an experimental 1.21 Minecraft client created with my vision and ideas. To be clear, I have no intention of stealing the work of mod creators. I made a GitHub repository with their mods because it was my only option. I have credited every creator and mod, but I do not have their permission.

## Fonctionnality's
1. Quality of life mods that does not exceed the cheat limit
2. Shaders, Emissive Textures and Connected Textures are supported with Sodium, Indium, Iris and Continuity
3. Every HUD mods are configured and works well together
